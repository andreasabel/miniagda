# The glob patterns used in MiniAgda.cabal are legal from
#   cabal-version: 2.4
# but the implementation in Cabal-2.4.0.0 is buggy.
# One could work around that by making a custom setup with
#   setup-depends: Cabal >= 3
# and then add
#   extra-deps: Cabal-...
# here.
# However, cabal does not deal well with custom setups, see
# https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/7577#issuecomment-906790525
# so, this isn't a solution worth pursuing.
# Resolution: do not support stack build with GHC < 8.8.
